# Mappster

## About
Mappster is a comprehensive solution designed for managing and visualizing mapping data with a focus on extensibility and high performance. Built on a microservices architecture, Mappster leverages the power of .NET technologies to offer robust RESTful APIs that cater to various mapping and geospatial data processing needs.

## Features
- **Dynamic Mapping**: Generate interactive maps based on user-defined parameters.
- **Data Processing**: Import, export, and manipulate geospatial data efficiently.
- **API Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with third-party services for enhanced mapping capabilities.
- **User Management**: Secure user authentication and authorization for accessing different levels of data and functionalities.

## Important Notes
- **Map Files**: Due to their size and sensitivity, map files detailing areas, points, streets, and postal areas are not included in this repository. You will need to obtain and configure these files in your local setup.
- **API Key**: This project utilizes the Google Maps API for various mapping functionalities. An API key is required to use these services, which is not provided in this repository for security reasons. Please replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` in the relevant configuration files with your own API key.
